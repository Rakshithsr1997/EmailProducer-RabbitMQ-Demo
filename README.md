ðŸ“© EmailProducer â€“ RabbitMQ with .NET 6

ðŸš€ Overview

EmailProducer is a .NET 6 Web API demo project showcasing how to implement asynchronous messaging using RabbitMQ.
It demonstrates a Producer (API that sends messages) and a Background Consumer (service that automatically listens and processes messages).
This project highlights a production-ready message-driven architecture commonly used in enterprise microservices.

Key Features:

ðŸ”¹ Producer â†’ Publishes messages into RabbitMQ queue.

ðŸ”¹ Background Consumer â†’ Auto-processes without manual trigger.

ðŸ”¹ Postman Tested â†’ Simple to validate via REST API.

ðŸ”¹ Scalable & Production-Ready â†’ Fits microservice communication.


Tech Stack:

ðŸ”¹ .NET 6 Web API

ðŸ”¹ RabbitMQ (Dockerized)

ðŸ”¹ Postman for API testing


Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of RabbitMQ with .NET 6 for building an event-driven and asynchronous communication system. By integrating a Producer service, a RabbitMQ Queue, and a Background Consumer, we created a workflow that ensures decoupled, scalable, and reliable message processing.

Through Postman testing and RabbitMQ Management UI verification, the project validates real-time message publishing and consumption. The architecture not only simulates a production-ready environment but also provides a clear roadmap for extending this solution into enterprise-level microservices.

In essence, the EmailProducer project showcases how modern distributed systems can be designed for efficiency, resilience, and scalability, making it a strong foundation for future enhancements such as logging, persistence, retry mechanisms, and monitoring.
